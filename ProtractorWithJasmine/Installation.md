## Step by Step download

1) Download NodeJs installer as we need to use npm to install protractor
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**What is npm?
npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that youâ€™re sharing, so you can build amazing things.

2) Open CMD and use npm command to install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager. Try running protractor --version to make sure it's working.

  npm install -g protractor

3)The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running. Use it to download the necessary binaries with:
 a) webdriver-manager update
 b) webdriver-manager start
    This will start up a Selenium Server and will output a bunch of info logs. Your Protractor test will send requests to this server to control a local browser. You can see information about the status of the server at
    http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.
